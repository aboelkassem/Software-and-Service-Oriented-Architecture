## Architecture overview

**Software Architecture** is the fundamental design of the software system. It defines what **elements** are included in the system, what **function** each element has, how each element **related** to another. In plain text, it is the big picture (overall structure) of the whole system.

Some considerations that the architect will consider while planning the structure of the system:

- What will the system be used for?
- Who will be using the system?
- What qualities matter most to them?
- Where will the system run?

**Why do we need software architecture?**

- Having a clear design of the system as starting point helps to provide **basis for developers to follow**, each developer will then know that **needs** to be implemented and how thing relate to meet the desired needs efficiently.
- **Higher productivity** for your software team, as a well-defined structure helps to coordinate work, implement individual features, or guide discussions on potential issues.
- A clear architecture will help to achieve **quality** in your software, with a well-design structure using principles like separation of concerns, the system will be easier to maintain and reuse.

**Stakeholders** are the people who have an interest in the software system or people who will using the system. So how **software architecture** help people like developers, end users, project managers and clients?.

- **Software Developers** ⇒ Software architecture helps developers create and evolve software by providing strong direction and organization on what needs to be done or built.
- **Project Managers** ⇒ Software architecture provides useful information to help them identify possible risks, manage the project successfully and understand task dependencies.
- **Clients** ⇒ Clients make important decision about the system like **funding**, if there a good architecture to understand what they are paying for and their needs are met.
- **End Users** ⇒ They care that if the app "works well" for them
